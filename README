Math Parser, a mathematical parser written in C++11

=== BUILD ===

To build, run make. Temporary compilation files will be written in the
obj/ directory. You could delete them by using make clean.
The built program will be named parser.

If you are not on a make-supported platform, then you should try to build
it by yourself. At the moment, I don't already have written a CMake file.
Moreover, I think it would be impossible to do so, as there is not yet any
standard CMake feature enabling C++11.

=== USE ===

Just run the parser file. Enter your expressions at the ">>>" prompt
I'm sorry, but at the moment all the text is written in french.

To get help, type "help" or "?" at the prompt. To quit, type "quit".

If you want to create a new variable, use "name = content".

If you want to create a new function, use "name(args) = content".

If you get "inf" of "nan" in the result, it is likely that you made an
invalid operation.
